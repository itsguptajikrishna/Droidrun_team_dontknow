U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has also been talking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He warned European countries not to retaliate over Trump's aim to take over Greenland and urged them to "have an open mind". "I tell everyone: Sit back, take a deap breath. Do not retaliate ... The president will be here tomorrow, and he will get his message across," he said.
